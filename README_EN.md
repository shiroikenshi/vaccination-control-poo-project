# Object-Oriented Programming - Vaccination Control System
This repository contains a vaccination control system implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming. The system allows for the registration, editing, listing, and deletion of individuals and vaccines. It includes a function that allows for vaccinating an individual (by selecting a valid person and vaccine registration) and a feature that displays general system data to the user, such as a list of vaccinated individuals, the total number of registered individuals/vaccines, and the overall quantity of available doses.
